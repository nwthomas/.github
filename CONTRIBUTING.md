# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

If you’ve found a bug or have an idea for an improvement, please open an issue. If you already have a fix or feature ready, you can open a pull request directly. If you’re not sure whether your idea is a good fit, you are encouraged to open an issue first so we can discuss it together.

All contributions should follow the existing code style and structure used in the repository. Changes that don’t align with the project’s style may be requested to be updated before being merged. It’s also best to keep changes focused and clear. Mmaller, well-defined contributions are easier to review and should be considered best practice.

Please keep in mind that these are personal projects and I work on them in my limited personal time. I will respond to all issues and pull requests, but not necessarily in a timely manner.
