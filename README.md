## Community Health Files

This repo contains all of my GitHub [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

Note that this repo is also open to contribution if you feel any of these community health files could be improved.

## Templates

The repo also contains some default files that I use when creating new repos.
